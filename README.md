# Spot_Fetch_a_Drink

This is the repository for Project Spot Fetch a Drink at Aalto University.

In this project, we are going to develop a voice command functionality for the [Spot Robot](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot).
Upon project completion, Spot would become a nice life assistant, which is able to take voice command from you and perform tasks, like fetching an object and going somewhere.
The applications of this project includes routine inspection and damage fixing in a large factory plant, autonomous guiding for blind people and daily care for the elderly/children or disabled people.
